My favorite restaurant there is Malvin's. It was a hangout, favorite hangout of the repack and especially Frank Sinatra. He had his wedding there, and stage, it was honeymoon if in the next door as well. I actually really liked being there in the middle of summer. It was absolutely stunning."

So things like holes in fabrics and lost buttons and zips which don't work anymore is just fixing that up.

A simple needle and thread is fine most of the time for more complex scenes like turning particular clothing into a different design that does require a sewing machine. A lot of the times I'm doing this by myself. Sometimes my sister and I will do it together, will do things like fix types because we love accessories."

It's a hub of energy and fun with friendships or made on memories."
